# PokeMiners Game Master
Repository for latest JSON and txt versions of the Game Master.

The `latest` folder will contain a .txt and a .json of the latest Game Master. Only one of each will be found here. They will always be called `latest.txt` and `latest.json`. This folder will also contain a `timestamp.txt` file that contains the timestamp/batch ID from the latest Game Master. This can be used to check if a new Game Master has been updated.

The `previous_game_master` folders will contain a timestamped folder for each previous Game Master release. Each folder will contain a .txt and .json file as well. Timestamp format is:

`gm`  
`gm_version`  
`apk_version`  
`year-month-day`  
`hour-minute-second`  

Original timestamp format is:

`gm`  
`gm_version`  
`apk_version`  
`day_of_week`  
`month_and_day`  
`hour_minute_second`  
`year`
